TOP HTML Foundations "Recipes" Project

This project is a review of Lessons 1 through 6 on how to write a basic HTML webpage including commonly used elements such as standard text, stylized text, images, and links.

The website is a basic HTML page that displays a homepage that will link to multiple recipes. The user will be able to click on an image of a dish which will direct them to its recipe including ingredients and instructions on how to make that particular dish.
